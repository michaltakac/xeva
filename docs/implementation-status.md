# Xreva Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Fully Implemented & Working

### Core Leva-like API
- `useControls` hook with Leva-compatible syntax
- Auto type inference for controls
- Folder organization support
- Zustand store architecture
- Control types: number, boolean, string, select, color, vector3, button

### Basic 3D Panel
- `XrevaPanel` component using @react-three/uikit
- Tab-based folder navigation
- All basic control widgets working
- Billboard mode support
- Customizable styling

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented (Has Issues)

### XR Features
- `useXRGrab` hook - Structure exists but has compilation errors:
  - Wrong API usage for @react-three/xr (using old v5 API instead of v6)
  - Type mismatches with uikit components
  - Missing proper XR session management

- `XrevaPanelXR` component - Structure exists but:
  - TypeScript errors with uikit property types
  - Button size variants don't match uikit-default API
  - Slider doesn't have 'size' prop in uikit
  - Root component doesn't support 'opacity' prop

## ‚ùå Not Implemented (Designed Only)

### XR Interactions
- Hand tracking support
- Pinch/point gestures
- Palm push interactions
- Visual feedback for hand rays

### Spatial Features
- Surface anchoring (wall/floor/ceiling)
- Controller anchoring
- Spatial grid snapping
- Multi-panel groups
- Panel layout management

### XR-Specific Controls
- 3D color sphere picker
- Spatial vector gizmo
- Physical toggle switches
- XR-optimized touch targets

### Advanced Features
- Voice control
- Gesture macros
- Collaborative panels
- AR surface detection
- LOD system for panels

## üîß What Needs Fixing

1. **Update @react-three/xr API usage**:
   - v6 uses different hooks than v5
   - Need to use `useXRStore` instead of old `useXR`
   - Controller API has changed

2. **Fix uikit component props**:
   - Remove unsupported props (opacity, size, etc.)
   - Use correct button variants
   - Fix Container styling approach

3. **Proper XR session management**:
   - Detect XR availability
   - Handle session start/end
   - Fallback for non-XR environments

## üìù Recommendations

For a working MVP, focus on:

1. **Fix the core XrevaPanel** - It mostly works, just needs minor fixes
2. **Skip XR features for now** - They need significant rework
3. **Polish the Leva-compatible API** - This is the main value proposition
4. **Add proper examples** - Show how to use with R3F projects

The XR features are ambitious but require:
- Deep understanding of WebXR API
- Correct @react-three/xr v6 implementation
- Extensive testing with actual VR devices
- Proper fallbacks for non-VR users

Consider releasing v1.0 with just the Leva-compatible 3D GUI, then add XR features in v2.0 after proper testing with Meta Quest 3 or similar devices.
